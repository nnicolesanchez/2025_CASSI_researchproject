    "   - As you have previous seen, the array containing all the gas mass in the galaxy looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```hnumber.g['mass']```\n",
    "  \n",

    "   - The array 'OxMassFrac' is the *oxygen mass fraction* of each gas particle. In other words, because each gas particle is really a cloud of gas, the 'OxMassFrac' quantity tells us \"how much of the mass of each gas particle is made up of oxygen\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   - So, to calculate the amount of oxygen mass in each gas particle in the galaxy:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```hnumber.g['mass'] * hnumber.g['OxMassFrac']```\n",
    "\n",
    "        *** Capitalization is important when calling column from the galaxy object/table\n",
    "      \n",
    "3. Finally, you need to use the function ```hdf5_ion_frac``` from Nicole to calculate the amount of OVI within the oxygen mass\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Just like you used the oxygen mass fraction to calculate how much oxygen mass there was in each gas mass, you similarly need to use the function to get the OVI Mass Fraction to be able to calculate how much OVI mass is present in each gas particle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - To do get this fraction, you'll need two things\n",
    "     \n",
    "     1. The hm2012_hr.h5 table which you can download in the [2025 Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h7cVDVEkkeqG-oaOLKNW4jld2MWzdRer?usp=drive_link)\n",

    "  \n",
    "      ``` from hdf5_Novi_R import hdf5_ion_frac ```\n",

    "      ```hnumber.g['mass'] * hnumber.g['OxMassFrac'] * OVI_mass_frac```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The resulting array is the *amount of OVI mass in every gas particle* in the galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once you calculate the sum of the array, you'll have the total OVI mass for the galaxy!\n",
